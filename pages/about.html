            <h4>How Has the Journey of the T20 World Cup Been Over the Years?</h4>
            <p>
                The T20 World Cup, first played in 2007, is an international cricket championship, usually held once every two years.
                Initially, it began as a 12-team competition in 2007. It was expanded to 16 teams from the 2014 edition and further extended to 20 teams for the 2024 edition, with teams divided into four groups.
